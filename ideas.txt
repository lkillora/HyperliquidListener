Scrape Hyperdash for every perp and HYPE spot -> gets positions and unrealized pnl and liquidation points

Label traders based on S3 + Hyperdash to have an idea -> for non-losers and less active accs with meaningful size save their positions

Alert if:
Alert if twap size (adjusted to 30 mins if >30 mins in length) is greater than 5% liquidity on that asset and > $250k in notional size —> frontrun/check who it is
Alert if twap size (adjusted to day or less) > the lowest OI of top 50 accs on that asset —> frontrun/check who it is
Alert if position with liquidation within 15% of current price is greater than the 5% liquidity —> frontrun/hunt?
(For positions which are more than the 5-10% liquidity mark) alert if some of this position is closed and notional > $100k -> frontrun/check who it is
(For large HYPE holders who are underwater and have large positions with near liquidation levels relative to the liquidity of HYPE spot) alert if they start selling HYPE
(For positions greater than 10% of liquidity) check orders to see if they have any market triggers that are greater than 5% liquidity
Alert if account on net does >10% of volume and > $300k in a five minute period. Can filter for clips > 10% of 5% liquidity
HYPE transfers >= $2m
HYPE twaps >= $2m

Check hyperdash every now and then to see if any informational positions open
Aggregation would be nice to see big whales with sloppy execution and cant just big thresholds because
Deposits/Withdrawals/Hyperunit movements are less informational and more noisy so leave for now

Goals:
Fetch positions for every coin using Hyperdash
Fetch liquidity for every coin using Hyperliquid with Proxy
Calculate 5% liquidity - can use linear estimate
Calculate top 50 position
Find positions with more than 5-10% liquidity mark
Find large HYPE holders with problematic position relative to HYPE spot liquidity
Check trigger market orders for massive positions (> 10% liquidity)
Websocket with dynamic filters

Just monitor it
Don’t work on aggregation
Don’t work on HYPE transfers yet (twaps should be captured by other process for now)
Ask Chun to update Chainbot for HYPE for my changes and then add HYPE transfers
